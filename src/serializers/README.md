# [Serialization](https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)
In computing, serialization (US and Oxford spelling) or serialisation (UK spelling) is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a { file } or memory data buffer) or transmitted (for example, over a computer { network }) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).
